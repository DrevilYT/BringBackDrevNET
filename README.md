## BringBackDrevNET
- DrevNET as you know it. Except, you have to host the server yourself, manually.

## Run in Powershell (7 or above)
- cd Downloads (or any directory you want it to be in)\
- curl -L -o DrevNET.zip "https://web.archive.org/web/20231219125250/https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/scl/fi/76u7ysnz4c3mjqjh17ry1/DrevNET.zip?rlkey=y8acl7pg7clz8i7srn12gglg8&dl=0"
