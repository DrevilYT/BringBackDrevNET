## BringBackDrevNET
- DrevNET as you know it. Except, you have to host the server yourself, manually.
- You can still use the normal DrevNET, until the 21st of March, 2024.
- After that date, this is your last choice if you still want to use DrevNET.

## Run in Powershell (7 or above)
- cd Downloads (or any directory you want it to be in)
- curl -L -o DrevNET.zip "https://web.archive.org/web/20231219125250/https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/scl/fi/76u7ysnz4c3mjqjh17ry1/DrevNET.zip?rlkey=y8acl7pg7clz8i7srn12gglg8&dl=0"

## Root Urls
- Old DrevNET Github Page: https://web.archive.org/web/20231219124954/https://github.com/DrevilYT/DrevNET
- Drev Server (Dropbox Buiseness/Enterprise): https://web.archive.org/web/20231219125250/https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/scl/fi/76u7ysnz4c3mjqjh17ry1/DrevNET.zip?rlkey=y8acl7pg7clz8i7srn12gglg8&dl=0 (exe included)
- Github Server: https://web.archive.org/web/20231219125108/https://codeload.github.com/DrevilYT/DrevNET/zip/refs/heads/main (exe excluded as usual)
- DrevNET in-app source code: https://web.archive.org/web/20231218205211/https://drev.rf.gd/drevnet (kinda broken atm)

## Info
- None of the urls or links are hosted by Drevil. (not anymore)
- They were saved by WaybackMachine.
- They might or might not be safe. It's all in the hands of WaybackMachine.
- These urls could go down anytime. (again, it's in the hands of WaybackMachine)

## Game Clients Services/Online
- All games will no longer work online since you are hosting your own server.
- However, you can portfoward your server and send it to other people to play with them.
- But still, some games such as GTA V will not work due to their own licensing.
- Other big games like GTA V wont work aswell.
- Just use Steam or Epic or some shit like that man.
